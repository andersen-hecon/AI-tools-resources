## Models

There are a few small language models that I particularly like, in part because I have benchmarked them against various models.

-   [Phi-3](https://huggingface.co/collections/microsoft/phi-3-6626e15e9585a200d2d761e3) is a surprisingly good model, despite its small size. I find that I usually turn to it when I want to a run a model on my desktop.
-   [Llama-3]() has, rightly, gotten a lot of buzz since it was launched because of its overall strong performance on various benchmarks. However, I have been less impressed with it in my small experiments using LM Studio's `Playground` feature.
