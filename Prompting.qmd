## Prompting
- Process of telling a generative AI what you want it to do
- Is not the same as a Google search
- More sophisticated GPTs can handle some of the prompting for you (e.g. [Consensus](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-bo0FiWLY7-consensus))

## Evaluating your prompts
Evaluating a prompt entails reviewing and considering the output the prompt produced
- Was the answer accurate?
- Was the tone appropriate?
- What about the length?

## The RACCCA framework
Developed by Andrew Maynar
- Relevance
- Accuracy
- Completeness
- Clarity
- Coherence
- Appropriateness
