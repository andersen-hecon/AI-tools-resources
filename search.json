I find that I usually turn to it when I want to a run a model on my desktop.\nLlama-3 has, rightly, gotten a lot of buzz since it was launched because of its overall strong performance on various benchmarks. However, I have been less impressed with it in my small experiments using LM Studio’s Playground feature."
